# connect_melodic
Shell script for analysis of rs preprocessing script output using MELODIC (fsl)

NOTE: A LARGE amount of fiddling (mostly paths) is needed to make these scripts usable. There is however a lot of built in functionality (define groups, dual regression etc).
In short, run it 'til it crashes then adjust. :D
